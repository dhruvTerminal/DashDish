# DashDish

Static restaurant website prototype with table booking and food ordering simulation.  
Built with pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript. No frameworks, no backend, no build tools.

**Current status (Feb 2026)**: Bare-bones proof-of-concept. Looks like a first-semester college project. Functional enough to click through, but production-ready? Not even close.

## What This Actually Is

A collection of disconnected static HTML pages pretending to be a restaurant web app called "DashDish".  
Main flows:

- Landing/home pages  
- User login  
- Menu browsing + fake ordering  
- Table reservation  
- Contact form (fake)

No real data persistence, no authentication, no payment, no admin panel, no API. Everything resets on refresh.
